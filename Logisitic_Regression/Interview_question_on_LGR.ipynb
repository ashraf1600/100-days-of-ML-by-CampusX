    "\n",
    "### What is Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **binary classification tasks** (e.g., spam vs. not spam, disease vs. no disease). Unlike **linear regression** which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the **probability** that an input belongs to a certain class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example**: Predicting whether a customer will buy a product ‚Üí `Yes (1)` or `No (0)`\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Core Concept: Sigmoid Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sigmoid function** maps any real-valued number to a value between **0 and 1**, representing probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $z$ is the linear combination of input features: $z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\dots + w_nx_n$\n",

    "### Q2: Why is Logistic Regression used for classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression **outputs probabilities**, which are then converted to class labels using a **threshold** (e.g., 0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "> If `P(y=1) = 0.8 > 0.5` ‚Üí predict class **1**\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q3: What is the Cost Function in Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression uses **log-loss** (or binary cross-entropy), which penalizes incorrect predictions more severely:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "J(\\theta) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[ y_i \\log(h(x_i)) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - h(x_i)) \\right]\n",

    "\n",
    "* $y_i$ = true label\n",
    "* $h(x_i)$ = predicted probability\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why not MSE?** Mean Squared Error (used in linear regression) does not work well for classification as it leads to **non-convex cost functions**.\n",
